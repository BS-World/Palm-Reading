- **Image Processing**: Upload palm images and analyze their features using OpenCV.
- **Interpretation**: Get detailed interpretations based on selected palm characteristics.
- **Save Results**: Save the palm readings and interpretations to a text file.
- **Help Section**: Access a help section for guidance on using the application.
